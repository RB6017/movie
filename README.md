This little program is a handy way to aggregate your favorite movies
Into an html page of movie trailers.

_There are two files of import in the package_
* entertainment_center.py
* media_info.json

Open media_info.json and you will find the proper method for adding new
movies to the generated html page. Simply follow the example syntax,
or refer to a [json guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

Once you have the proper urls in place, save your new media info,
and run:

> $ python entertainment_center.py

Once this command has been run, you should automatically see a new page
in your browser containing the movie posters you have linked to, and
clicking a specific movie poster will play the selected youtube trailer.
